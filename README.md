# Streamlabs Scripts
## Description
This is just a repository where I am going to store my streamlabs scripts.

## Can you change anything?
You are welcome to fork this and make changes to them as you please, as long as the core variables stay the same (For Example: Cooldown, reward, cost, currency name etc.) This is will be obsolete once JSON config files are implemented. (see plans section for details)

**Note:** Please comment the code on any changes you make to the best of your ability. If I cannot understand the code by looking at the comment, I likely will not merge it to the master repository. I also ask is that you please do not complete the plans/tasks I have outlined below. This is after-all for fun, and if someone goes and does all the things I want to learn how to do, it wrecks it for me.

## Plans

 - Join Command
 I plan on leaving this be for a little while. I like where it is in terms of functionality and do not have plans to change it significantly.

- Slots Script
I plan to learn how to use the JSON settings format in python to make a configuration file for the script. This will allow for things like changing the emotes it uses, what emote does the jackpot, the rewards, currency name, responses and the user cooldown. This is a little bit of a task for me, and given my current schedule and motivation I have no ETA for when this will be done.
Once that is complete, I also plan to introduce a GUI in streamlabs for it so you can change the JSON settings without needing to edit the file in a text editor. This is a more advanced task that I will likely start a second directory for as I might have to change a large portion of the code base to implement.
