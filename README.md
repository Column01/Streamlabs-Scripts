# Streamlabs Scripts (DO NOT USE)

## NEW VERSION

I have since migrated to a custom chatbot over [here](https://github.com/Column01/Simple-Chatbot). If you want to use them, you can, but I recommend my chatbot.

**These are awful. Don't use them.**

#### Example:

I used **17** global variables in my slots script [here](https://github.com/Column01/Streamlabs-Scripts/blob/master/Colin's%20Slots/slots_StreamlabsSystem.py)... Garbage.
