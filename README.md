# Streamlabs Scripts
## Description
This is just a repository where I am going to store my streamlabs scripts.

## Can you change anything?
You are welcome to fork this and make changes to them as you please, as long as the existing variables stay the same (For Example: Cooldown, reward, cost, currency name etc.)

**Note:** Please comment the code on any changes you make to the best of your ability. If I cannot understand the code by looking at the comment, I likely will not merge it to the master repository. I also ask is that you please do not complete the plans/tasks I have outlined below. This is after-all for fun, and if someone goes and does all the things I want to learn how to do, it wrecks it for me.

## Plans

 ### Join Command
 I plan on adding a .JSON config file system like I did for the slots script.

### Slots Script
I layed the groundwork for a .JSON Config file system for the Slots script, but it still leaves much to be desired. It needs a GUI in streamlabs so you can change the JSON settings without needing to edit the file in a text editor. This is a more advanced task that I will have to a lot of tinkering for and I have already learned so much recently and feel like I need a little break to work on other projects I have in the mix.

**Note:** Please be nice when criticising my code! I am new to this more intermediate style of coding. The only thing I learned in computer science in school was to write a story instead of being logical and having things like classes, functions and efficient coding. If my code is sloppy, please help me learn how to improve it. Rather than saying "Your code looks like a monkey slapped his extremities on a keyboard till it spit out this garbage!", try something more constructive like "I like the idea you had here, but you could make it more efficient if you did this.".
